# This is a Lab project for a Compuetr Animation class at Uni-Bonn

In this project algorithms from the [Project MultiLeap: Making Multiple Hand Tracking Sensors to Act Like One](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357257620_Project_MultiLeap_Making_Multiple_Hand_Tracking_Sensors_to_Act_Like_One)
paper by Tomáš Nováček and Marcel Jirina are implemented.

*Note:* Those algorithm implementations, though in theory can be used with real-time sensor readings, have been designed with simulated readings in mind.

## To create an executable for this project:
1. Create a build directory in the root folder:
```
mkdir build
```
2. Build using cmake
```
cd ./build
cmake .. -G"MinGW Makefiles"
make
```
